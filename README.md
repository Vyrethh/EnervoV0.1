this is a prototype/foundation for an upcoming network scanner but its lowkey the prototype of the prototype? it's 0.1? thats not even 1 its not even the full thing

anyways like thers gonna be a lot of stuff in the actual thing this is just what im like starting with or something? i dont know
but to run this (idk why you'd want to run this one, you can only scan google.com but who cares)

yk you're gonna be able to do basic stuff like actually choose the ip (which you cant do in this one lol), uhh trust me its gonna have some juicy stuff

also you need scapy so uh python3 too, i'll put it in the requirements.txt or something for the real networkscanner

not completely sure why i posted this, but its up so..... yeah
