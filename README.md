# Network Scanner (Prototype)

**For educational purposes only.**

This is an early prototype of a network scanning tool â€” very limited for now. It currently only targets `google.com` and lacks input flexibility.

Planned features:
- Custom IP selection
- Expanded scanning logic
- Improved output and automation

Requires:
- Python 3
- `scapy` (will be added to `requirements.txt` in the future)

This version is mostly a reference for future development.
